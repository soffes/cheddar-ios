# Cheddar for iOS

[Cheddar for iOS](http://cheddarapp.com/apps) is the universal iPhone and iPad application for [Cheddar](http://cheddarapp.com), a simple & instant task manager.

**You can download Cheddar for iOS [free on the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id524382948?partnerId=30&siteID=gCug0Bwa2R0).**


## Getting Started

Run the following commands to get started:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/nothingmagical/cheddar-ios.git
    $ cd cheddar-ios
    $ rake setup

Now open the Xcode project and build. You will see one error telling you to fill in your API credentials. If you don't already have API credentials, head over to the [Cheddar developer site](http://cheddarapp.com/developer). Be sure to set `cheddar://oauth` as your redirect URI.

Need help? Email <support@cheddarapp.com> or open an issue with specifics.


## Why is this open source?

This is open source since the app is free already. It is intended to be a source of sample code for everyone to benefit from. You can make cool apps that use Cheddar and I hopefully get more users because you built something awesome.

Also, if you want to help out and fix some bugs, I'll love you forever. Maybe you'll even get a shirt or something :)


## License

While it is not strictly forbidden by the license, I would greatly appreciate it if you didn't redistribute this app exactly the way it is in the App Store. There's nothing stopping you, but please don't be a jerk.


## Contributing

If you want to fix bugs, I'll love you forever! If you want to add some features, I may not merge it. I'm sure it will be awesome, but defending Cheddar's simplicity is my utmost duty.
